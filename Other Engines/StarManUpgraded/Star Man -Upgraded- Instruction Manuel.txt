-Star Man's Shield

Star Man's only method of attack remains launching his 
shield at his opponents. In order to do this you must 
create the shield while on the ground, and shoot it in 
any direction once in the air. Please note that if an 
enemy touches the shield before you have launched it, the shield will disappear.

The shield can also be used for a defense against enemy bullets. 


--Abilities

Like Mega Man, Star Man can obtain a special weapon by defeating a Robot Master, or in this case, a Stardroid. However, being Star Man it works differently. 

In order to inherit the Stardroid's ability you must find a crystal hidden in his level. Please note however that you don't gain as many points from defeating the boss if you have crystals from previous levels.

Rather than obtaining an actual weapon, you obtain permanent upgrades to your shield.


--Items

-Energy Pellets: These restore your health. You can find them around the levels and occasionally enemies will drop them when defeated.

-Lives: Gain an extra life when you grab one of these. They resemble Star Man's head. Losing one of these results in also losing 30 points.

-Energy Tank: Accessed from the pause menu, these completely refill your energy. You can carry up to four at a time.

-P Chips: Small ones add five points to your score, large ones add ten points.

-Star Chip: A special bonus that adds 200 points to your score. One is hidden in each level.

-Crystals: (See "Abilities")
